Hi, my name is Mike Cleron. I'm an engineer on the Android Development Team.

Android is an open software platform for mobile development. It is intended to
be a complete stack that includes everything from the operating system through
middleware, and up through the applications.

Now I'm going to focus in detail on a few of the APIs that I think provide
fertile ground for innovation.

The first is the location manager. This is a set of APIs that allows you to get
geographic information. It will let you find out your current location, and it
will also let you register to receive notifications if you get close to
something interesting. So you can actually register, you can register an intent
with the location manager that will be fired when you get close to a point that
you specify. And that lets you do things like being notified when you get close
to one of your friends, or it lets you be notified when you get close to, say,
an ice-cream shop that has particularly good ice-cream in it. It has that kind
of an interesting innovative application with this kind of API enables. The
location manager will use GPS if the device comes equipped with GPS. If it
doesn't, it will make do with whatever information is available that might be
getting information from cell tower IDs or if there's a Wi-Fi network that has
geographic location information in it, we'll use that information to try to at
least narrow down where you are.

While building applications for the Android platform, we found that it was
useful to have and always on data connection so that the server could send
notifications to devices running the Android platform. It turned out that it's
such a useful piece of infrastructure that we decided to package it up and make
it available as part of the public framework. And that has been done by creating
the XMPP Service APIs. The XMPP Service allows any application to send
device-to-device data messages to any user who's running Android upon their
device. Now that data can be whatever information make sense with the
application. So for a multiplayer game, that might be that I've moved my knights
to a particular location, or whatever make sense for the game. But it could also
be something else like geographic information. So with appropriate permissions
and security, the user could send their location to their buddies so that their
buddies could actually see where they are at any given time and plot that
information on a map. Again, this works with any Gmail account, so any
application can send this type of peer-to-peer messages without having to build
any server infrastructure.

The next API is one of my favorites. It's called the Notification Manager, and
it allows any application to put a notification into the status bar. We use the
status bar for things like SMS notifications, voicemail notifications, all of
the typical things you'd expect to see on a phone. However, we make that same
facility available to any application. And so, that means the developers can
have the same power to alert the user to interesting events as what have
traditionally been built-in applications. This has a lot of benefits. First, it
means that all notifications have a consistent presentation. Now the way we do
it in the UI, we have a visible preview of what the notification means. So if an
icon appears in the status bar, you can click on it or touch it to make it
active so you can see a preview of what it means, which means you don't have to
figure out what each of 30 different hieroglyphics means. Then, if you want to
act on that notification, you can simply touch on it and you will be taken to
whatever application is responsible for that notification. This allows a lot of
really interesting scenarios. It means that applications can notify you of
things like when an auction is ending, or if someone has invited you to be their
friend on a social network, or if a bus is coming. And all of those
notifications can have the same level of prominence in the UI as something like
voicemail or the other built-in notifications.

And finally, I'd like take a minute to talk about the view system in Android.
Android provides a really rich toolkit of built-in views, and you can use those
to assemble your applications out of standard parts. So we provide things like
playlist view and a grid view, a gallery view. We provide all the standard
widgets like buttons and check boxes. And by combining those things, you can
build your applications really quickly. We've also done a lot of work in the
framework to support multiple input methods and multiple screen sizes and
multiple keyboard configurations in the view system itself so that you don't
have to worry about that in your application. So for example are list of views
work with touch but they also work if you want to drive them with a [INDISTINCT]
D-pad. And that's just a built-in facility of the view framework. In addition to
that sort of views, we also are introducing two really innovative views. The
first is a map view. This is an actual, this is an implementation of the same
map rendering that's in our maps application. But we decided to make that
available as a view so that applications can have really tight integration with
geographic data. So it's, of course possible to always launch the map
application to display a particular location. But what the maps view let you do
is actually embed a map view in your location so that you can control it from
you own code so you can set it to a particular locations, zoom in, zoom out, pan
the map, control all of that from you own code to build whatever kind of
application you want to build based on that. We've done something similar with
the browser. There's a browser application that you can launch to display a
webpage, but we also have a web view that enables you to embed HTML content as a
view in your application that you can then fill with whatever data make sense
for your app.

Personally, what I'm hoping to see come out of the Android effort is the kind of
innovation that comes from what I call a mash up effect. We really had two goals
in mind when we set out to create Android. The first was to provide developers
with a powerful toolkit for building new types of experiences. This toolkit
includes things like the application framework, the view system, things like the
maps view and the web view that you can embed in your application,
device-to-device messaging through XMPP, location services, notifications, and
all the other pieces of our API. But the second and more important goal was to
be sufficiently open and extensible to allow these pieces to be combined in ways
that we really haven't imagined yet.

If you're interested in finding out more about Android, I encourage you to visit
the developer site and download the SDK. In the SDK, you will find a lot more
documentation and sample code, and you'll also be able to try built-in
applications of your own. There's also a developer group that you can join to
find out more information. And I also encourage you to check back frequently
because we'll be posting updates to the SDK as the platform of your choice.
Thank you for watching.
